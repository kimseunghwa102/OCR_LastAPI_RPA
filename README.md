# OCR_PostAPI_RPA
As part of the Mitutoyo OCR project, I am wrote Python code using Clover OCR's Last API to verify PoC.

## Enter Clover OCR’s API key value
Please enter a value for null
* api_url = 'null'
* secret_key = 'null'

Please enter the path to the folder where pdf and png format files to be OCR processed are stored.
* directory_path = 'null'

## How to enter field values
And in the keys below, you must write the names of each labeled field in Clover OCR.
* keys = ["",""]
example
keys =  ["작성자", "접수번호", "의뢰자", "형식", "기기번호"]
